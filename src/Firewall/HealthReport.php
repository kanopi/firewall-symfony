/**
 * A health snapshot of the running firewall, shaped for a monitoring probe.
 *
 * Reports the four things a firewall can be wrong about in a way that looks
 * identical to working:
 *
 *  1. **A rule that is not running.** A plugin whose constructor throws — a
 *     Redis host not answering, a storage path that lost its permissions —
 *     is logged and skipped, and the request is evaluated by the rules that
 *     did build. For an `allow` rule that is merely annoying; for a `block`
 *     rule it is a fail-open, and a firewall running three rules short looks
 *     exactly like a firewall running correctly.
 *  2. **A rule that is running blind.** The Redis backends catch a
 *     connection failure, log it, and answer every read as though nothing
 *     were stored. The plugin constructs, so (1) reports nothing, while a
 *     rate limit rule counts nothing and lets everything through.
 *  3. **A panic file holding the switch down.** The realistic failure is not
 *     somebody flipping it during an incident; it is nobody noticing three
 *     weeks later that it is still on.
 *  4. **A mode that is not the configured one**, which is (3) seen from the
 *     other side, plus the bundle's own translation of `block` to
 *     `exception` when `blocked_response: http_exception` is set.
 *
 * ## This is not for the request path
 *
 * `getFailedRules()` and `getDegradedBackends()` **build every rule** to
 * answer, because rules are constructed lazily and a firewall that has
 * evaluated nothing has nothing that could have failed yet. Building a rule
 * is what opens its storage connection, which is what makes the answer worth
 * having — and which is why this belongs in a command and behind the
 * profiler's `collect_health` flag, not in the listener.
